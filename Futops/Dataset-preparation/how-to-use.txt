First you need to download the videos from youtube, and internet 

you can use this command 

youtube-dl -a path.txt  (path of the videos urls)
or also you can search manual

After that you need to
extract frame from video i have used FFMPEG
simple just run this script

python histogram.py --i input_folder_name(which is content videos)
after that you receive usefull frame not repeated frame becouse i have used histogram matching for this 

then start ananotation for training i am using bbox tool for dataset preparaion
jsut run

python main.py
